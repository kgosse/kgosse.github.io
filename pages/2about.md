Hi,  

I'm an [ivorian][ivory coast] developer living in [paris, France][paris].

   **hmm... what else can I say about me ?**

I believe in God. We can trust God when he says that there will be a resurrection and if you did
good things, you'll have an everlasting life unlike to those who did not. So this life has a purpose and
nothing is over even after death. That's why Jesus came on earth, for this Good News.
I highly recommend everybody to be humble and to read the Bible.
So that's my belief !

Apart from that, I'm a passionate developer. For the time being, JavaScript is the language I'm the most proficient with.
I have good knowledge of Node, Angular (1 && 2), Ionic (1 && 2), React, React Native, NativeScript,
Electron etc. I like challenges and I do love helping build great things.
